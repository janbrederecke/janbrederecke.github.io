<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>I have both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in psychology. After my studies I
initially worked as a researcher in psycho-oncology before transitioning to the
domain of epidemiology. Here I use a mixture of classical statistical
and modern machine learning methods to conduct lots of survival analyses in
different cohort studies and build predictive models for the onset of
cardiovascular disease. I have been using R since I was an undergraduate and
still learn something R everyday! As a side-hustle I am currently finalizing
my doctoral thesis.</p>

<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<p>As a researcher / research analyst I have authored and co-authored several
research papers, most of which should be listed
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fzccSmMAAAAJ"><em>here</em></a>.</p>

<h2>R PACKAGES</h2>
<p>When I find the time, I develop R packages that are designed to improve data
analysis workflows in my current projects.
Right now I work on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/janbrederecke/prepareD/"><em>prepareD</em></a> - functions for data
preparation, project templates, and documentation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/janbrederecke/analyzeD/"><em>analyzeD</em></a> - functions for
automated linear, logistic, and Cox regressions across multiple predictors /
outcomes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/janbrederecke/visualizeD/"><em>visualizeD</em></a> - functions for
often used variants of ggplot2 visualizations.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/janbrederecke/predicteD/"><em>predicteD</em></a> - functions to help
build Shiny apps based on predictive models that cannot be exporting including
the original data (important e.g. in Cox-models).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the packages are still in their early development
stages but will be be updated regularly in the future.
Additionally, I am a contributor to the
<a href="https://github.com/johnkarlen/climbeR/"><em>climbeR</em></a> package that is designed to
visualize results of random forest models and will soon be available again on
CRAN.</p>

<h2>R SHINY</h2>
<p>Lately, I developed a passion for R Shiny and I currently work on multiple
Shiny apps e.g. for predictive scores in the domain of cardiology.</p>
